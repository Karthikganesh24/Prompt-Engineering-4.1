## EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques
## Aim:
To create a comprehensive report for the design of a specific application, such as AI-powered chatbot/solar panel system/automation in manufacturing, using diverse prompt patterns. This report will employ scenario-based prompting techniques to guide each stage of the design process, ensuring the solution meets the functional and user experience requirements for the chosen application.
## Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Outline the purpose of the design, the target audience or user base, and its main objectives. Specify the goals the design aims to fulfill, such as user engagement/energy efficiency/task automation.
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Select appropriate prompt patterns to guide different aspects of the design. Examples of prompt patterns and their applications in the report include:
o	Idea Generation Prompts: Brainstorm innovative features or functions the design should incorporate to meet specific goals.
o	Persona and Context Prompts: Define the tone, style, or experience the design should convey (e.g., user-friendly/sustainable/reliable), aligning with the intended audience.
o	Exploratory Prompts: Investigate resources or information essential for the design, such as user needs/environmental constraints/technical requirements.
o	Refinement Prompts: Refine design elements by adjusting specifications, materials, or style to meet project standards.
o	Scenario Testing Prompts: Simulate realistic scenarios or use cases to test the design’s effectiveness and adaptability in user interaction/environmental settings/production workflows.
o	Error Handling Prompts: Design prompts to handle potential issues or challenges effectively within the user interface/system functionality/automation processes.
3.	Implementation Plan:
Describe the steps to build and implement the design, from system configuration/component selection/automation setup to testing and deployment/installation/integration.
4.	Evaluation and Feedback Collection:
Use targeted feedback prompts to gather insights from users/stakeholders/operators, refining the design based on their input for improved functionality and alignment with objectives.
5.	Documentation of Findings:
Summarize insights from each prompting technique, noting how they enhanced the design. Include any best practices, limitations, or future improvements.
Deliverables:
1.	Detailed Report:
o	Sections covering aim, background, audience needs, and primary objectives.
o	Documentation of prompt patterns applied at each development stage, with examples.
o	Evaluation and feedback summaries with key findings.
2.	Prototype/System Outline:
o	A functional version or detailed outline of the AI-powered chatbot/solar panel system/automation setup.
3.	Prompt Effectiveness Summary:
o	Analysis of the most impactful prompt patterns, with examples of how they shaped the final design.
4.	User Testing Results and Improvement Plan:
o	A report on testing, feedback received, and proposed enhancements for future iterations.

# Algorithm:
**1: Daily Health Advice (Zero-Shot Prompting)**

Scenario:
An elderly user with hypertension asks:
"What should I eat today to manage my blood pressure?"

Prompt:
“What are some recommended dietary tips for a person with high blood pressure?”
Response (Zero-shot):
“For managing high blood pressure, it’s best to eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy. Reduce sodium intake, avoid processed foods, and drink plenty of water. Foods rich in potassium like bananas and spinach can also help.”

Effectiveness:
Straightforward and effective for simple queries, especially when no prior context is given.

**2: Personalized Medication Reminder (Few-Shot Prompting)**

Scenario:
MediGuide needs to remind patients to take medications based on past patterns and preferences.

Prompt:
User Query: "What medicines should I take this morning?"

Few-shot Examples:
User: “What medicine should I take tonight?”
MediGuide: “At 8 PM, you should take Amlodipine 5mg for blood pressure and Metformin 500mg for diabetes.”

User: “What’s my afternoon dose?”
MediGuide: “At 1 PM, take 1 tablet of Metformin 500mg with food.”
Actual Prompt: “What medicines should I take this morning?”

Response (Few-shot):
“At 8 AM, you should take 1 tablet of Amlodipine 5mg and 1 tablet of Metformin 500mg with breakfast. Please have a glass of water and avoid caffeine right after.”

Effectiveness:
Improves consistency by learning from prior examples. Best for routines.

**3: Complex Symptom Explanation (Chain-of-Thought Prompting)**

Scenario:
The patient reports unusual symptoms like fatigue and dizziness.

Prompt:
“I’ve been feeling dizzy and tired lately. What’s wrong with me?”
Chain-of-thought prompting:
“Let’s consider possible reasons. Dizziness and fatigue can be caused by low blood pressure, low blood sugar, dehydration, or medication side effects. Since you are on Amlodipine and Metformin, these symptoms could relate to your medications or diet.”

Response:
“Let’s analyze this. Dizziness and fatigue may be caused by low blood sugar due to Metformin or a side effect of Amlodipine lowering your blood pressure too much. Did you skip a meal or take extra medicine? I recommend checking your blood sugar and pressure and contacting your doctor if this continues.”

Effectiveness:
Encourages step-by-step reasoning, useful in triaging complex inputs.

**4: Emotional Support and Motivation (Role-Based Prompting)**

Scenario:
A user says they feel discouraged about their health.

Prompt:
“You are a friendly and empathetic digital health assistant. Your goal is to comfort elderly users and gently motivate them.”
User: “I feel like I’m not getting better. This is exhausting.”

Response:
“I understand it can be really hard. You’ve been doing your best, and every small step counts. Managing your health takes time, and I’m here for you every day. Let’s set one simple goal today—maybe a short walk or a healthy meal. You’ve got this!”

Effectiveness:
Human-like empathy through persona emulation helps improve user morale.

 **5: Exercise Guidance Using Visual Inputs (Multi-Modal Prompting)**

Scenario:
A user wants help with a knee-friendly arthritis workout by uploading an image of a yoga mat and resistance bands.

Prompt:
Text Input: “Can you suggest a gentle exercise for arthritis with this setup?”
Image Input: (photo of yoga mat and resistance bands)

Response (Multi-modal):
“Great setup! With your mat and bands, you can try seated leg lifts or gentle resistance band stretches for your knees. These reduce stiffness and improve flexibility. I can show you a 3-minute guided video if you like.”

Effectiveness:
Combines image understanding with tailored advice—ideal for context-aware interaction.
