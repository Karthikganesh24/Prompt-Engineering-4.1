2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Select appropriate prompt patterns to guide different aspects of the design. Examples of prompt patterns and their applications in the report include:
o	Idea Generation Prompts: Brainstorm innovative features or functions the design should incorporate to meet specific goals.
o	Persona and Context Prompts: Define the tone, style, or experience the design should convey (e.g., user-friendly/sustainable/reliable), aligning with the intended audience.
o	Exploratory Prompts: Investigate resources or information essential for the design, such as user needs/environmental constraints/technical requirements.
o	Refinement Prompts: Refine design elements by adjusting specifications, materials, or style to meet project standards.
o	Scenario Testing Prompts: Simulate realistic scenarios or use cases to test the design’s effectiveness and adaptability in user interaction/environmental settings/production workflows.
o	Error Handling Prompts: Design prompts to handle potential issues or challenges effectively within the user interface/system functionality/automation processes.
3.	Implementation Plan:
Describe the steps to build and implement the design, from system configuration/component selection/automation setup to testing and deployment/installation/integration.
4.	Evaluation and Feedback Collection:
Use targeted feedback prompts to gather insights from users/stakeholders/operators, refining the design based on their input for improved functionality and alignment with objectives.
5.	Documentation of Findings:
Summarize insights from each prompting technique, noting how they enhanced the design. Include any best practices, limitations, or future improvements.
Deliverables:
1.	Detailed Report:
o	Sections covering aim, background, audience needs, and primary objectives.
o	Documentation of prompt patterns applied at each development stage, with examples.
o	Evaluation and feedback summaries with key findings.
2.	Prototype/System Outline:
o	A functional version or detailed outline of the AI-powered chatbot/solar panel system/automation setup.
3.	Prompt Effectiveness Summary:
o	Analysis of the most impactful prompt patterns, with examples of how they shaped the final design.
4.	User Testing Results and Improvement Plan:
o	A report on testing, feedback received, and proposed enhancements for future iterations.
## Usecase:
Smart Helpdesk Chatbot for College IT Services
1. Input Validation Prompt
Purpose:
The main aim of the Input Validation Prompt is to ensure that the user’s input is in the correct format. It prevents errors by validating the data before it's processed or used in the system. This is especially important when asking for information like email addresses, student IDs, or phone numbers.
How It Works:
The chatbot prompts the user to input data (e.g., an email address), then checks the format to ensure it aligns with the expected pattern. If the user inputs an invalid email or ID, the chatbot provides feedback and asks them to enter the correct information.
Example Scenario:
•	The chatbot asks: “Please enter your college email address for password reset.”
•	The user inputs "john.doe123", which is invalid.
•	The chatbot responds: “That doesn’t look like a valid email address. Please enter in the format: name@college.edu.”
Benefits:
•	Ensures clean data for backend processing.
•	Prevents errors, like password resets going to the wrong email.
•	Guides users to submit the correct input format.

2. Multi-turn Prompting
Purpose:
Multi-turn Prompting is useful for gathering more detailed information from the user through a series of questions. This approach simulates natural conversation, where the chatbot asks follow-up questions based on the user’s previous answers. It’s essential for troubleshooting or solving complex issues.
How It Works:
When a user reports an issue (e.g., Wi-Fi connectivity), the chatbot doesn’t give a solution right away. Instead, it asks a series of questions that narrow down the issue step-by-step, ensuring the problem is identified accurately before providing assistance.
Example Scenario:
•	User: "I can’t connect to Wi-Fi."
•	Chatbot: "Are you using a laptop or a mobile device?"
•	User: "Laptop"
•	Chatbot: "Is the Wi-Fi network visible in your list of available networks?"
•	User: "Yes"
•	Chatbot: "Have you tried restarting your device?"
Benefits:
•	Helps the chatbot gather all relevant information to resolve the issue.
•	Makes the process feel like a natural conversation.
•	Provides more accurate solutions by considering all possible causes.

3. Fallback Prompt
Purpose:
Fallback Prompts are used when the chatbot doesn’t understand the user’s input. This can happen if the user types something ambiguous, unclear, or out of context. Instead of ending the conversation, the chatbot gently redirects the user to clarify their request or pick from predefined options.
How It Works:
When the chatbot cannot interpret what the user has typed (e.g., "My laptop is crying"), it triggers a fallback prompt asking the user to clarify or rephrase their input. The fallback message also offers help or options for the user to choose from.
Example Scenario:
•	User: "My laptop is crying."
•	Chatbot: "I’m sorry, I didn’t understand that. Could you please rephrase your issue or choose an option from the menu?"
•	Or: "It looks like you’re describing an issue with your laptop. Please select the type of problem you’re facing: [1] Wi-Fi, [2] Software, [3] Hardware."
Benefits:
•	Keeps the conversation going even when input is unclear.
•	Helps users to express their concerns in different ways.
•	Reduces frustration by offering guidance or alternative paths.
Conclusion
The Smart Helpdesk Chatbot for College IT Services integrates a variety of prompting techniques to enhance user experience and streamline the process of addressing IT-related issues. By implementing Input Validation Prompts, Multi-turn Prompting, and Fallback Prompts, the chatbot becomes a more effective, user-friendly tool for troubleshooting and support.
•	Input Validation Prompts ensure that users provide accurate data, preventing errors and allowing the system to function smoothly.
•	Multi-turn Prompting facilitates more accurate problem-solving by guiding users through a series of logical questions to gather all necessary information.
