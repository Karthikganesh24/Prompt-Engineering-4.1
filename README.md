## EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques
## Aim:
To create a comprehensive report for the design of a specific application, such as AI-powered chatbot/solar panel system/automation in manufacturing, using diverse prompt patterns. This report will employ scenario-based prompting techniques to guide each stage of the design process, ensuring the solution meets the functional and user experience requirements for the chosen application.
## Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Outline the purpose of the design, the target audience or user base, and its main objectives. Specify the goals the design aims to fulfill, such as user engagement/energy efficiency/task automation.
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Select appropriate prompt patterns to guide different aspects of the design. Examples of prompt patterns and their applications in the report include:
o	Idea Generation Prompts: Brainstorm innovative features or functions the design should incorporate to meet specific goals.
o	Persona and Context Prompts: Define the tone, style, or experience the design should convey (e.g., user-friendly/sustainable/reliable), aligning with the intended audience.
o	Exploratory Prompts: Investigate resources or information essential for the design, such as user needs/environmental constraints/technical requirements.
o	Refinement Prompts: Refine design elements by adjusting specifications, materials, or style to meet project standards.
o	Scenario Testing Prompts: Simulate realistic scenarios or use cases to test the designâ€™s effectiveness and adaptability in user interaction/environmental settings/production workflows.
o	Error Handling Prompts: Design prompts to handle potential issues or challenges effectively within the user interface/system functionality/automation processes.
3.	Implementation Plan:
Describe the steps to build and implement the design, from system configuration/component selection/automation setup to testing and deployment/installation/integration.
4.	Evaluation and Feedback Collection:
Use targeted feedback prompts to gather insights from users/stakeholders/operators, refining the design based on their input for improved functionality and alignment with objectives.
5.	Documentation of Findings:
Summarize insights from each prompting technique, noting how they enhanced the design. Include any best practices, limitations, or future improvements.
Deliverables:
1.	Detailed Report:
o	Sections covering aim, background, audience needs, and primary objectives.
o	Documentation of prompt patterns applied at each development stage, with examples.
o	Evaluation and feedback summaries with key findings.
2.	Prototype/System Outline:
o	A functional version or detailed outline of the AI-powered chatbot/solar panel system/automation setup.
3.	Prompt Effectiveness Summary:
o	Analysis of the most impactful prompt patterns, with examples of how they shaped the final design.
4.	User Testing Results and Improvement Plan:
o	A report on testing, feedback received, and proposed enhancements for future iterations.

# Algorithm:

# output:
# Use Case 1: Arthritis - Daily Advice
# Zero-shot Prompt:
```
Provides basic, general advice.
Output: Generic exercise and diet tips.
```

# Few-shot Prompt:
```
Builds on previous advice for continuity and personalization.
Output: Personalized follow-up with gentle yoga and hydration tips.
```
# Role-based Prompt: 
```
Assigning a specific role (virtual physiotherapist) results in detailed guidance.
Output: Comprehensive morning routine with stretches, warm-ups, and breathing practices.
```
# Use Case 2: Hypertension - Monitoring and Alerts
# Chain-of-Thought Prompt: 
```
Encourages the AI to reason step-by-step, fostering an informative and educational response.
Output: Breaks down BP readings, explains potential risks, and recommends medical consultation.
```

# Few-shot Prompt: 
```
Tracks trends in blood pressure readings, providing context to fluctuations.
Output: Offers a clearer understanding of the readings and lifestyle changes (diet check).
```

# Use Case 3: Diabetes - Emotional Support
# Role-based Prompt:
```
Positioning the AI as a supportive companion allows for a nurturing, empathetic response.
Output: Provides motivational words and stress reduction strategies.
```
# Multi-modal Prompt: 
```
Combining images (sugar readings) with text enhances response by analyzing data and offering calming tips.
Output: Generates a comprehensive response with visual data analysis, along with voice-based guidance.
```
# conclusion:
The experiment illustrates how using advanced prompting techniques significantly boosts the relevance, personalization, and emotional intelligence of AI health assistants. The tailored responses are particularly beneficial for elderly patients managing chronic conditions. By applying these methods, MediGuide can be made more effective, offering not just clinical support but also empathetic, motivational assistance for users, increasing their trust and satisfaction with the system.





## Result:
The Smart Helpdesk Chatbot effectively resolved IT issues by using input validation, multi-turn, and fallback prompts, resulting in faster support and improved user experience.
